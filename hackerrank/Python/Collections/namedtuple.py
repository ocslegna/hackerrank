"""
Basically, namedtuples are easy to create, lightweight object types.
They turn tuples into convenient containers for simple tasks.
With namedtuples, you donâ€™t have to use integer indices for accessing members of a tuple.

Named tuples are especially useful for assigning field
 names to result tuples returned by the csv or sqlite3 modules:

__
DATA is a STUDENT list that takes as arguments those returned
 by the * operator when applying a resulting list of splitting the input.
